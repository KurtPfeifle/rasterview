# RasterView v1.5

RasterView (macOS name) or rasterview (Linux name) is a small GUI application spezialized to visualize CUPS-, PWG- and Apple-raster files as they are generated by CUPS and other software to print to AirPrint capable or IPP Everywhere compliant printers.

It allows you to look at the (multipage) raster data produced for printing by any of the standard CUPS RIP filters (cgpdftoraster, imagetoraster, pdftoraster, and pstoraster). It is normally used to either test those filters or visualize at the data that is being sent to your raster printer driver. Additionally it is able to display the 'Page Attributes' which are embedded into the data to control the behavior of printer drivers

RasterView is free software written by Mike Sweet and provided under version 2 of the GNU General Public license.

## AppImage binary for Linux users

Experimental releases of binary 'AppImage' builds for 64bit Linux users are available
from Kurt Pfeifle's forked repository:

    https://github.com/KurtPfeifle/rasterview/releases

To use these for testing:

1. Download the current .AppImage
1. Make it executable: `chmod +x rasterview-*.AppImage`

See below how to generate CUPS-, PWG- and Apple-raster test files.

## Requirements

If you plan on (re)compiling it, you'll need FLTK 1.3.x (http://www.fltk.org/)
and a C++ compiler.


## How to Compile

Run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make


## How to Use

The program is called "rasterview" on UNIX/Linux and "RasterView.app" on macOS.
Run the program and then open a raster file, or pass the filename on the
command-line.  You can view multiple files simultaneously.

The "test" subdirectory in the sources includes a script for generating raster
data using the standard RIP filters.  Run the following command for help:

    tools/maketestfiles.sh help
