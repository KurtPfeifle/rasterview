REQUIREMENTS

You'll need CUPS 1.2 or higher installed to use RasterView.  If you plan on
(re)compiling it, you'll also need FLTK 1.1.x or 1.3.x (http://www.fltk.org/)
and a C++ compiler.


HOW TO COMPILE

Run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make


HOW TO USE

The program is called "rasterview" on UNIX/Linux and "RasterView.app" on Mac OS
X.  Run the program and then open a raster file, or pass the filename on the
command-line.  You can view multiple files simultaneously.

The "test" subdirectory includes a script for generating raster data using the
standard RIP filters.  Run the following command for help:

    tools/maketestfiles.sh help
